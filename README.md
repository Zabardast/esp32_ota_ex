# esp32_ota_ex
test esp32_ota for a friend!! ;)

### plan v0.1:

I have 2 esp32's (red and black)

red: will be my local AP because i need an AP that is in reach of their tiny antennas.

black: test subject.

#### the test subject:

the test subject will be a tcp client to my pc's tcp server and send `hello world!` initialy, but after being updated the message will be `OTA Baby!!!`.
